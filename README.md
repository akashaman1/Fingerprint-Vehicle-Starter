# Fingerprint-Vehicle-Starter
The project involves using Embedded C and C++ programming languages to interact with the fingerprint sensor and Arduino board. The registered fingerprint data is stored in fingerprint sensor and the code to start the vehicle is stored in Arduino. The registered person can only access the vehicle by just putting the finger in fingerprint sensor.
